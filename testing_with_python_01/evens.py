There are a few issues with the code in both test_evens.py and evens.py:

1. test_evens.py
Syntax Error in the TestEvens Class: You are missing a colon (:) after the class definition.
Incorrect if Statement: The if statement should check for __name__ == '__main__' (with double underscores).
Corrected test_evens.py:

python
Copy code
def even_number_of_evens(numbers):
    """
    This function checks if there is an even number of even numbers in the list.
    """
    return True  # Replace this with your actual logic

print(even_number_of_evens([5]))  # Example usage
