There are a few issues with the code in both test_evens.py and evens.py:

1. test_evens.py
Syntax Error in the TestEvens Class: You are missing a colon (:) after the class definition.
Incorrect if Statement: The if statement should check for __name__ == '__main__' (with double underscores).
Corrected test_evens.py:

python
Copy code
def even_number_of_evens(numbers):
    """
    Should Raise a TypeError if a list in not passed into the function
    error message: "A list was not passed into the function"
    if the list is empty it will return False
    if the number of even numbers is odd - return False
    if the numner of even numbers is even - return True
    """
    if isinstance(numbers, list):
        if number == []:
            return False
    else:
        return True 
    else:
        raise TypeError("A list was not passed into the function")


if __name__== '__main__':
print(even_number_of_evens([5]))  # Example usage
